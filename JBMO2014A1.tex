Notice that $2014\le n+\sqrt{n}+\sqrt[3]{n}<2015$. Also notice that $n+\sqrt{n}+\sqrt[3]{n}=f(n)$ is monotically increasing because $n,\sqrt{n},\sqrt[3]{n}$ are all increasing. Note that $f(1957)<2014$ and $f(1958)>2014$. Also note that $f(1959)>2015$. So the only possible solution is $1958$. It works, so the answer is $\boxed{1958}$. $\blacksquare$
