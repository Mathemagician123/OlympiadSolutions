Assume $2^n+12^n+2011^n=k^2$. Taking $\pmod{3}$, we have $(-1)^n+1=k^2\pmod{3}$. Notice that if $n=0\pmod{2}$, $(-1)^n=1$, implying that $k^2=2\pmod{3}$, which is impossible. Thus $n$ must be odd.

Assume $2^n+12^n+2011^n=k^2$. Taking $\pmod{4}$, we have $2^n+(-1)^n=k^2\pmod{4}$. Since $n$ is odd, $(-1)^n=-1$, so $k^2=2^n-1\pmod{4}$. If $n\ge 2$, using the fact that $n=1\pmod{2}$, we have $2^n=0\pmod{4}$, giving $k^2=-1\pmod{4}$, which is impossible.

Thus $n<2$, and $n=1\pmod{2}$. The only such $n$ is $\boxed{1}$, and checking yields that it works.
