Notice that $\angle BIA=180-\frac{A+B}{2}$, and $\angle BCI=\frac{C}{2}$, hence $\angle BOI=C$.
Due to the fact that $BO=OI, \angle BIO=90-\frac{C}{2}$ and $\angle AIB+\angle BIO=180$, thus $A,I,O$ are collinear.
Then $I$ lies on the perpendicular bisector of $ED$, and so $O$ does as well.
Thus $ADOE$ is a kite, which solves the problem.
