Suppose for the sake of contradiction that the statement is wrong. Thus all the numbers must have distinct residues modulo $100$. L
Let $S:=\{1,2,\cdots,100\}$ and let $S'\subset S$ be the set of the residues of said numbers. Due to the fact that $52>51$, we get by pigeonhole
that $S'\cap (S-S')\ne \emptyset$, contradiction.
