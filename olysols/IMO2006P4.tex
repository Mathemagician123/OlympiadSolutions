Factoring,
$$2^x(1+2^{x+1})=(y+1)(y-1)$$
This implies that one of $y+1, y-1$ has $\nu_2$ less than or equal to $1$.
Hence $y=2^{x-1}a+b$ for odd $a$ and $b^2=1$. Hence
$$2^{x-2}(a^2-8)=1-ab$$
Clearly $b=-1$, so
$$2^{x-2}(a^2-8)=a+1$$
This is a finite check since the LHS grows much faster in $a$ than the RHS.
The solutions then are $(0,\pm 2)$ and $(4,\pm 23)$.
