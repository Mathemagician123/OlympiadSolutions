Suppose that the number is some permutation of
$$1234567890$$
(with $0$ not the leading digit, of course). This number is divisible by $9$. Notice that
repeatedly applying $S(n)$ preserves $n$'s residue modulo $9$ (well-known).
But
$$7^{1996}\equiv (-2)^{1996}\equiv 2^{1996}\equiv (-1)^{665}\cdot 2\equiv 7\pmod{9}$$
contradiction.
