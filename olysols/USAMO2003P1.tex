I claim that the possible $m$ for $n+1$ is just the $m$ for $n$ with a new odd digit at the beginning. This sufficiently solves the problem (obviously $5^n$ is $\le$ n digits otherwise 5 is larger than 9).
To prove this, we use induction. The base case is easy, for $n=1$, we can use $m=5$. Then the new number is $(2k+1)\cdot 10^{n-1}+a\cdot 5^{n-1}=5^{n-1}\cdot ((2k+1)2^{n-1}+a)$, so we just need to show that there exists some $k$ such that $(2k+1)2^{n-1}+a\equiv 0\pmod{5}$ for some fixed a.
Or rephrased, $(2k+1)2^r\equiv t\pmod{5}$ has solutions for $k$ for any $t,r$. This is true since the odd digits are complete $\pmod{5}$, so we're done.
