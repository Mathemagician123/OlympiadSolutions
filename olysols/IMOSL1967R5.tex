Summing the arctans with the formula,

$$\arctan\left(\frac{x+y+z-xyz}{1-(xy+yz+xz)}\right)=\frac{\pi}{4}$$
$$x+y+z-xyz=1-(xy+yz+xz)$$
$$xyz=xy+yz+xz$$

So $x,y,z$ are roots of $t^3-t^2+kt-k=0$, where $k=xyz=xy+yz+xz$. This factors
as $(t^2+k)(t-1)=0$. So the roots are $1, \sqrt{-k}, -\sqrt{-k}$, from which the
result comes immediately.
