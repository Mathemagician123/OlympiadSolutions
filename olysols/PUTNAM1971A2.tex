I claim that the answer is only $f(x)=x$.

Let $S$ be the set of numbers $x$ such that $f(x)=x$. It suffices to show that the
cardinality of $S$ is infinite.

Suppose for the sake of contradiction that $S$ has finite cardinality. Due to
the fact that $f(0)=0$, $S\ne \emptyset$. Then it is valid to let $k$ be the maximum
element found in $S$. Notice that $f(k^2+1)=f(k)^2+1=k^2+1$, thus $k^2+1\in S$, contradiction.
