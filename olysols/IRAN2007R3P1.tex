This turned out to be more of a logic puzzle than a math problem.

First of all, the vertices are of the form $t, -t, p, -p$. It's a rhombus if and only if $p=rit$ for some real $r$.
Notice that there must exist some complex numbers $t, r$ such that
$$z^4+az^2+b=(z^2-t^2)(z^2+r^2t^2)$$
And then $a=t^2(r^2-1), b=-r^2t^4$. Hence $\frac{a^2}{b}=-\left(\frac{r^2-1}{r}\right)^2$, which is non-positive real
if and only if $r\in\mathbb{R}$, i.e. $p=rit$, done.
