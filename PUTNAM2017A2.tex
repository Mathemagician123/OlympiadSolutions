\maketitle
Note that $Q_nQ_{n-2}-Q_{n-1}^2=-1=Q_{n+1}Q_{n-1}Q_n^2$, i.e. The quantity $\frac{Q_{n+1}+Q_{n-1}}{Q_n}$ remains constant as $\frac{Q_0+Q_2}{Q_1}=\frac{1+x^2-1}{x}=x$.  Hence $Q_{n+1}=xQ_n-Q_{n-1}$. I prove that all $Q_i\in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ by induction. The base case is obvious (take the example). This is trivial since the polynomial ring $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ is closed under multiplication and addition, but $+\sim -$, i.e. its closed under subtraction as well -- done.
